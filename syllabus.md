# Databases: Building Dynamic Websites

Spring 2012

Tuesdays, 6pm - 8:40pm

2 W13th Room 1108

## Course Description

This course will teach you how to build dynamic websites. We will explore how you can use PHP and MySQL, as well as Node.js and MongoDb to build web applications. We will be learning about a variety of open-source technologies along the way. Student interests will to some extent influence the topics we cover, and students are encouraged to bring any outside projects which apply to the subject matter.



## Expectations

* Be on time. Three absences results in failing the class. Two late arrivals constitutes one absence.

* Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, or else be curious enough to learn. Ideally you will have some experience with Javascript, Flash, Processing, or some other presentation layer technology, but this is not a requirement for the course.

* We'll be doing some pair-programming in class. Collaboration is encouraged. Play nice, and help each other out.

* Bring your other projects to class. It's always helpful to see how topics covered in those classes apply to your other projects.

* You must not plagiarize. You are allowed to use code you find online. I have learned a great deal myself by finding online examples and incorporating them into my work. However, this is a gray area, and the discretion is mine, as to what enters into the realm of plagiarism. Please indicate your online sources in the comments to your program, and be able to explain what is going on in any snippet of code you borrow. This alone should be sufficient to avoid any issues.



## Grading and Homework

Assignments will be due at the beginning of the following class. Homework must be fully-working. Assignments will be scored in the following manner: ⅓ credit is given for functionality, ⅓ credit is given for solving the problem outlined in the assignment, and another ⅓ credit applies for presentation (design) when applicable. Some assignments will have no real points for presentation, these assignments will require you submit a text file as your answer. These will split credit ½ for functioning, ½ for solutions.

Make sure your homework runs. I cannot stress this enough. After all, this is a class about computer programming and successful compilation is the fundamental quality of good code.

You have one get-out-of-jail card on homework assignments. This means that if your work is late, it will be forgiven one time, but you will still be expected to complete the assignment.

The final project that will be assigned will require pulling together all the knowledge you have accrued through the course and implementing a fully functional program.  You'll be able to come up with the overall concept yourself.  But, you'll be expected to lay out a set of specifications and the project will be judged based on the same criteria as homework assignments.



## Readings 

There will be a variety of reading assigned for the first few weeks. The expectation is that you will have read the material ahead of class, so everyone is prepared with questions to discuss. This comes into play in the participation aspect of your grade.

## Reading

All reading is online. There are no required textbooks. Everything we need is online. These links all point to the official manuals or the language reference. They are very technical, there are cheat-sheets available online for all of these. Find one you like.

### Books

If you like books, I find the following to be more-or-less indispensible:

* MySQL Pocket Reference, 2nd Edition By George Reese
* CSS Pocket Reference, 3rd Edition By Eric A. Meyer
* JavaScript Pocket Reference, 2nd Edition By David Flanagan
* jQuery Pocket Reference, First Edition By David Flanagan

All these pocket books are great, the full versions offer greater detail. Cute covers.

* [Learning PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript, First Edition By Robin Nixon]
* The Art of Unix Programming By Eric Raymond
